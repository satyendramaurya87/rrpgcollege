                <h1>About us</h1>

               <p> This college was established by Amethi area's Prakash Pillar, late Rajarshi Ranjaya Singh, with the motive of his benevolent revered father Rajarshi Bhagwan Bakhsh Sinh, with the aim of realizing the dreams of his education in
                            the pious memory of his late Shri Ranvir Singh in 18 August 1959. Keeping the human values and principles in his mind, he established this institution and continued to discharge them throughout his life. Highly influenced by
                            Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya's ideals of education, Rajarshi considered education as an important foundation for the all-round development of Amethi region. Rajarshi's view was that 'education is the axis of development'. If every
                            person becomes educated and virtuous, then every kind of development starts automatically. Keeping this basic formula in mind, he established from primary school to postgraduate college, so that even the poorest of the poor
                            can impart higher education to their children. At that time in the Amethi region where there were few educated children in thousands. At the same time, these educational institutions established by Ranveer Rananjaya Singh had
                            the effect that today a sufficient number of undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD degrees are available in each village. 
                       </br> </br>Adequate number of students from Amethi region and neighboring states of Bihar and Rajasthan also come
                            to study here. Initially, this college was attached to Agra University and then to Gorakhpur University. In 1975, it was attached to Awadh University, Ayodhya, which is named as Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University, Ayodhya.
                            Discipline and time bound reading have been the specialty of this college. From time to time it has been praised by the scholarly scholars here from the free gorge. After one year of the establishment of the college, in 1960,
                            His Excellency the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, V.V. Giri, who also became the President of the Republic of India in 1969, said in the convocation address held in the premises of the college. "Ranvir Rananjaya Degree College,
                            away from the toxic and polluted environment of the big cities, can provide more educational service than residential universities." These words of Mr. V.V. Giri sir are still popular in the college. It is often seen that graduates
                            of institutions like Allahabad University also take admission in this college to get a Masters degree and get good marks.</br></br> If the credit of all the goodness of the college is given to Mr. Rajarshi himself, then there will be
                            no exaggeration. He loved this college like his son. Just as a father is elated at seeing his son, similarly Rajarshi was pleased to see the college. Therefore, they must have visited the college at least once a day. The rites
                            of Rajarshi are confluent in every particle of the college. . Late in 1979, Smt. Indira Gandhi, the Iron Lady of India, increased the prestige of the college by providing letters of appreciation and books to late Rajarshi Rananjaya
                            Singh. The discipline, reading and examination conduct of this college is very high. The brilliant students who got educated from here are increasing their pride by working in Indian and provincial administrative services and
                            higher educational institutions. The students and students of this college have established honorable places in inter-university and inter-university sports competitions and have set new standards. The college administration
                            expects its students to be fully disciplined and take care of themselves with dedication and dedication, and following the rules of virtue, always keep on the path of progress. The current Amethi-Naresh and Member of Parliament
                            (Rajya Sabha) Dr. Sanjay Sinh, the able son of Rajarshi Ranjaya Sinh, has all the rights and duties of the Chairman of the College Management Council. Under the direction of Dr. Sanjay Sinh, the college is on the path of continuous
                            progress. </br></br>Despite all your political and social engagements, you are constantly working for the multi-faceted development of the college. It has been the culmination of your efforts that along with arts and education, science
                            and commerce faculty has also been established in the college. With your generous support, there is a 'Girls Common Room' and a 'Gymnasium' hall equipped with sports equipment for the students of the college. From the session
                            2019-20 onwards, classes of social work, psychology, physical education, art and Urdu are going to be conducted in the Faculty of Arts, MA Education. The session with the generous cooperation of Dr. (Mrs.) Rani Ameeta Sinh,
